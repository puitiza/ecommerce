#The microservice needs to know the location of the Config Server. In the bootstrap.properties or bootstrap.yml file
#(note that it's bootstrap, not application, because this configuration is required very early in the startup phase),
#specify the URI of your Config Server:
spring:
  application:
    name: order-service
  profiles:
    active: prod

  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8885
