## Spring Cloud Config Server - README.md

**Welcome to the Spring Cloud Config Server for your Ecommerce Platform!**

This server acts as the central hub for managing application configurations used across your microservices. It allows you to store, version control, and dynamically deliver configuration settings to your applications, facilitating flexibility and easier maintenance.

**Key features:**

* **Centralized configuration:** Manage all configuration in one place, eliminating redundancy and inconsistencies.
* **Version control:** Track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
* **Environment-specific configurations:** Tailor configurations for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
* **Multiple sources:** Leverage multiple sources like Git repositories, Vault, or custom providers.

**Accessing configurations:**

You can access configuration data through several methods:

* **REST API:** Use `/application/{applicationName}/{profile}` or `/application/{applicationName}/{label}` endpoints to retrieve configurations for specific applications and profiles or labels.
* **Environment variables:** Spring Cloud Config Server automatically injects configuration values as environment variables into your applications.

**Examples:**

1. Retrieve the default configuration for the `application` service:

```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8885/application/default'
```

2. Retrieve the dev configuration for the product-service service:

```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8885/product-service/dev'
```


**Further exploration:**

* Explore the Spring Cloud Config Server documentation for detailed configuration and usage options: [https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-config/)
* Read the provided documentation for your specific implementation of Spring Cloud Config Server (e.g., Spring Boot).

**Security considerations:**

* Secure the access to your Config Server using authentication and authorization mechanisms like basic authentication, OAuth2, or Keycloak.
* Only store sensitive configuration values in secure locations like encrypted files or external secrets management tools.
* Avoid exposing unnecessary configuration details through the REST API endpoints.

**Note:** Update URLs and port numbers according to your configuration.
