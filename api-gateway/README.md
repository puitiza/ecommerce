# Api-Gateway

Spring Cloud Gateway provides a powerful way to handle HTTP traffic between microservices. It also provides several
mechanisms for securing the gateway, including JWT.

**JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** are a popular way of securely transmitting information between parties. A JWT is a string that
consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature

Therefore, your approach is correct. You've utilized both mechanisms to enable CORS for different scenarios:
- **Keycloak token:** Enables internal API gateway calls to other resources on behalf of the user.
  "allowed-origins": ["http://localhost:8090"]
- **CorsWebFilter:** Enables Swagger UI on localhost:9090 to access the API gateway directly.

This approach provides flexibility and ensures both internal and external communication is handled correctly with respect to CORS.
