# About the project

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
These stages include checking out code, performing quality code analysis, building and pushing Docker images,
and deploying the services on a Kubernetes cluster.

The architecture uses several services and tools for different purposes:

  <li>This project is based Spring Boot 3.0 Microservices with the usage of Docker and Kubernetes</li>
  <li>User can register and login through auth service by user role (ADMIN or USER) through api gateway</li>
  <li>User can send any request to relevant service through api gateway with its bearer token</li>
</ul>

7 services whose name are shown below have been devised within the scope of this project.

- Config Server
- Eureka Server
- API Gateway
- Auth Service
- Order Service
- Payment Service
- Product Service
- User Service as Producer
- Comment Service as Consumer

## Using docker-compose 
These docker-compose commands can be used for various purposes, and here's a breakdown of how they're useful in different situations:

1. **docker-compose up --build -d:**
   - Use case: For development and quick testing where you need to constantly update the code and rebuild containers with the latest changes.
   - Explanation:
     - `up`: Starts all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
     - `--build`: Forces a rebuild of all service images before starting them, even if the image already exists.
     - `-d`: Starts the services in detached mode (background).

2. **docker-compose down -v:**
   - Use case: For cleaning up the environment completely after development or before applying significant changes.
   - Explanation:
     - `down`: Stops and removes all containers created by docker-compose.
     - `-v`: Also removes all volumes associated with the services. 

3. **docker-compose up -d:**
   - Use case: For production or staging environments where the code is stable and changes are infrequent.
 
### Additional notes:

You can combine these commands for specific workflows. For example, `docker-compose down -v && docker-compose up --build -d` would first clean up the environment and then rebuild and start all services.

Consider using environment variables with docker-compose for sensitive information such as passwords or database credentials.
Use docker-compose volumes instead of bind mounts for persistent data that needs to survive container restarts.
