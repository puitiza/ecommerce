#The microservice needs to know the location of the Config Server. In the bootstrap.properties or bootstrap.yml file
#(note that it's bootstrap, not application, because this configuration is required very early in the startup phase),

spring:
  application:
    name: product-service
  profiles:
    active: dev
  cloud:
    config:
      # On local machine -> localhost but on container use the another way
      #uri: http://localhost:8885
      uri: http://config-server:8885
      # the label must correspond with the branch name in GitHub
      label: main
